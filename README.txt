# Audio Narrative
 
Summary:

	In this podcast, focus is placed on the critical point of overlap of mental health and high-level sports. The podcast looks at the unique stress put on athletes, balancing the extreme demands of their sport with the personal problems of daily life. I talk about how athletes, under constant pressure to perform, are prone to mental health struggles but have to act like they are "okay" at all times.

	The episode discusses the tragic story of Morgan, a standout lacrosse player for Duke, whose battle with anxiety and depression worsened after suffering a season-ending knee injury. Although she was helped at first, Morgan's mental illness worsened, and she died by suicide in 2019. Her story is a tragic reminder of the importance of addressing mental health among athletes so that similar tragedies may not befall anyone in the future.

	The podcast also presents two mental health tools for supporting athletes. Mindfulness grounds athletes, which is linked with better emotional regulation. CBT has been proven to reduce anxiety and depression. I suggest implementing mindfulness and CBT in team cultures, in addition to weekly sessions, to help athletes cope with stress and enhance overall mental well-being.

	Finally, the episode encourages ending the silence regarding mental health talk in sports, encourage prevention-minded mental health approaches, and establish a supportive culture for sport performers. The podcast calls on action to hold sports to their obligations to create safe environments to play with appropriate support resources available to prevent losing another Morgan.
