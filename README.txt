# Audio Narrative
 
Summary:

In this podcast I explore the link between mental illness and high-level sports. I elaborate on a D1 athlete and how she lost her life to mental illness. I have grown up playing and watching sports and being a D1 athlete myself I can attest to the struggles we face daily. Sometimes these can add up and be more than daily stress. I emphasize the importance of implementing practical exercises on sports team such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises. Listen to this podcast to learn more about the importance of recognizing athletes for their jam packed lives and learning that it is ok not to be ok all of the time.
